## Code

Source: https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/two/sample-code

    Good sample code is often the best documentation.

A good code example is:

1. Without errors.
2. Perform the task it claims to perform.
3. Be as production-ready as possible.
4. Descriptive class, method, and variable names.
5. Commented

   - Focus your commenting energy on anything non-intuitive in the code.
   - When your readers are very experienced with a technology, don't explain what the code is doing, explain why the code is doing it.

6. Reusable

   - Can be run immediately (preferably)
   - Can be extended or customized in useful ways.
