1. Introduce each list and table
2. Choose the correct type of list

- Unordered: the order of items is interchangeable
- Ordered: if the order is changed the meaning is lost
- Embedded (inside the sentence): a poor choice, try to avoid it

2. Keep list items parallel

- Same style, same punctuation, same logic

3. Start numbered list items with imperative verbs
4. Punctuate items appropriately

- If the list item is a sentence, use sentence capitalization and punctuation. 
- Otherwise, do not use sentence capitalization and punctuation
