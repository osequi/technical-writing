## Short sentences

Source: https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/short-sentences

1. Shorter sentence reads faster than large sentence
2. Focus each sentence on a single idea

   - Reduce subordinate clauses (optional)

3. Convert some long sentences to lists

   - When you see the conjunction or in a long sentence, consider refactoring that sentence into a bulleted list.
   - When you see an embedded list of items or tasks within a long sentence, consider refactoring that sentence into a bulleted or numbered list.

4. Eliminate or reduce extraneous words

   - causes the triggering of vs. triggers
   - is able to vs. can

5. Reduce subordinate clauses

   - When alongside the main idea (clause) another sub-idea is paired
   - Ex: `Python is an interpreted programming language, which was invented in 1991`
   - Keywords to avoid:

     - which
     - that
     - because
     - whose
     - until
     - unless
     - since

6. Distinguish that from which (essential vs. nonessential subordinate clauses)

   - which: nonessential
   - that: essential (it is required for the full meaning)
   - Ex: `Fortran is perfect for mathematical calculations that don't involve linear algebra.`
   - If you read a sentence aloud and hear a pause just before the subordinate clause, then use which.
   - If you don't hear a pause, use that.
   - Place a comma before which; do not place a comma before that.
