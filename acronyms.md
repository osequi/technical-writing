## Acronyms

Source: https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/words#use_acronyms_properly

1. Don't define acronyms that would only be used a few times.
2. Do define acronyms that meet both of the following criteria:

   - The acronym is significantly shorter than the full term.
   - The acronym appears many times in the document.

3. Put both the spelled-out version and the acronym in **boldface**.
4. Do not cycle back-and-forth between the acronym and the expanded version in the same document. Only use the acronym.
