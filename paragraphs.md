## Paragraphs

Source: https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/paragraphs

1. Write a great opening sentence

   - The opening sentence establishes the theme of the paragraph
   - Busy readers focus on opening sentences and sometimes skip over subsequent sentences

2. Focus each paragraph on a single topic

   - A paragraph should represent an independent unit of logic.
   - When revising, ruthlessly delete (or move to another paragraph) any sentence that doesn't directly relate to the current topic.

3. Don't make paragraphs too long or too short

   - 3-5 sentences
   - maximum 7 sentences

4. Answer what, why, and how

   1. What are you trying to tell your reader?
   2. Why is it important for the reader to know this?
   3. How should the reader use this knowledge. Alternatively, how should the reader know your point to be true?
