1. Read it loud

   - To check the style (alienating, engaging, or even boring)
   - Make it others to read it loud

2. Come back to it later

   - After 1, 2, 3 hours, or next day

3. Change the context

   - Print it
   - Or display with other colors, layouts, and so

4. Find a peer editor

   - It's like code review / testing
   - Before release it should be tested
