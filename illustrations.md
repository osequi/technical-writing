## Illustrations

1. Write the [[caption]] first
2. Constrain the amount of information in a single drawing
	
	- Don't put more than one paragraph's worth of information in a single diagram.
	- Avoid illustrations that require more than five bulleted items to explain
	- If these are not possible start with the big picture. After showing the "big picture," provide separate illustrations of each subsystem.

3. Focus the reader's attention

	- Use callouts

4. Illustrating is re-illustrating
5. Illustration tools
