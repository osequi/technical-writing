Active Voice Sentence = actor + verb + target
Passive Voice Sentence = target + verb + actor

Passive verb = form of be + past participle verb
Active (imperative) verbs = verb

Active voice provides the following advantages:
1. Most readers mentally convert passive voice to active voice. Why subject your readers to extra processing time? By sticking to active voice, readers can skip the preprocessor stage and go straight to compilation.
2. Passive voice obfuscates your ideas, turning sentences on their head. Passive voice reports action indirectly.
3. Some passive voice sentences omit an actor altogether, which forces the reader to guess the actor's identity.
4. Active voice is generally shorter than passive voice.

Be boldâ€”be active.
