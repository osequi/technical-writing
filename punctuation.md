## Punctuation

1. Commas

   1.1 In sentences that express a condition, place a comma between the condition and the consequence.

   Ex: `If the program runs slowly, try the --perf flag.`

   1.2 Wedge a quick definition or digression

   Ex: `Python, an easy-to-use language, has gained significant momentum in recent years.`

   1.3 Avoid using a comma to paste together two independent thoughts.

   Ex: `Samantha is a wonderful coder. She writes abundant tests.`

2. Semicolons

   - A semicolon unites highly related thoughts.
   - The thoughts preceding and following the semicolon must each be grammatically complete sentences.
   - Reversing the two sentences must still yield a valid result, too.
   - Don't use transition words (however, therefore, ...) after semicolon

3. Em-dashes

   - An em-dash represents a longer pause—a bigger break—than a comma.
   - Use a pair of em-dashes to block off a digression.

4. Parentheses

   - To hold minor points and digressions.
   - The enclosed text isn't critical.
   - If a pair of parentheses holds an entire sentence, the period goes inside the closing parenthesis.
   - If a pair of parentheses ends a sentence but does not hold the entire sentence, the period goes just outside the closing parenthesis.
