## Clear sentences

Source: https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/clear-sentences

    Comedy writers seek the funniest results, horror writers strive for the scariest, and technical writers aim for the clearest.

In technical writing, clarity takes precedence over all other rules.

1. Choose strong verbs

   - occurs vs. triggers
   - happens vs. generate

2. Reduce there is/there are

   - There is can be always removed
   - There are can be replayed with You

3. Minimize certain adjectives and adverbs

   - screamingly fast vs 225-250% faster
