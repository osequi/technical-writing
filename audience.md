```
good documentation = knowledge and skills your audience needs to do a task âˆ’ your audience's current knowledge and skills
```

1. Define your audience / Audience analysis

   - Roles: Personas, like in UX Design
   - Proximity to the knowledge: What is the current knowledge of the audience.

2. Determine what your audience needs to learn

   - Write down a list of everything your target audience needs to learn to accomplish goals

3. Fit documentation to your audience

   1. Vocabulary and concepts
   2. Curse of knowledge: Experts understanding is difficult to translate into novice level
   3. Simple words
   4. Cultural neutrality and idioms: Avoid things like kosher, piece a cake, etc.
