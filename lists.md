## Lists

Source: https://developers.google.com/tech-writing/one/lists-and-tables

1. Introduce each list and table (like in [[illustrations]] and [[tables]])
2. Choose the correct type of list

   - Unordered: the order of items is interchangeable
   - Ordered: if the order is changed the meaning is lost
   - Embedded (inside the sentence): a poor choice, try to avoid it

3. Keep list items parallel

   - Same style
   - Same punctuation
   - Same logic

4. Start numbered list items with imperative verbs
5. Punctuate items appropriately

   - If the list item is a sentence, use sentence capitalization and punctuation.
   - Otherwise, do not use sentence capitalization and punctuation
